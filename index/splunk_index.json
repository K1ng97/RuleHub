      "description": "This detection identifies potential exploitation of a critical SQL injection vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM), identified as CVE-2024-29824. The vulnerability, which has a CVSS score of 9.8, allows for remote code execution through the `RecordGoodApp` function in the `PatchBiz.dll` file. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the `goodApp.md5` value in an HTTP POST request to the `/WSStatusEvents/EventHandler.asmx` endpoint, leading to unauthorized command execution on the server. Monitoring for unusual SQL commands and HTTP requests to this endpoint can help identify exploitation attempts. Note that, the detection is focused on the URI path, HTTP method and status code of 200, indicating potential exploitation. To properly identify if this was successful, TLS inspection and additional network traffic analysis is required as the xp_cmdshell comes in via the request body.",

This is detected when a user logs into a host and the GroupMembership field in event 4627 indicates a privileged group (e.g., Domain Admins), but the user does not actually belong to that group in the directory service. The detection leverages Windows Security Event Log 4627, which logs account logon events. The analytic cross-references the GroupMembership field from the event against a pre-populated lookup of actual group memberships. Its crucial to note that the accuracy and effectiveness of this detection heavily rely on the users diligence in populating and regularly updating this lookup table. Any discrepancies between the events GroupMembership and the lookup indicate potential ticket forging. Kerberos ticket forging, especially the Diamond Ticket attack, allows attackers to impersonate any user and potentially gain unauthorized access to resources. By forging a ticket that indicates membership in a privileged group, an attacker can bypass security controls and gain elevated privileges. Detecting such discrepancies in group memberships during logon events can be a strong indicator of this attack in progress, making it crucial for security teams to monitor and investigate. If validated as a true positive, this indicates that an attacker has successfully forged a Kerberos ticket and may have gained unauthorized access to critical resources, potentially with elevated privileges.",

Anonymous pipes are commonly used by legitimate system processes, services, and applications to transfer data between related processes. However, adversaries frequently abuse anonymous pipes to facilitate stealthy process injection, command-and-control (C2) communication, credential theft, or privilege escalation. This detection monitors for unusual anonymous pipe activity, particularly involving non-system processes, unsigned executables, or unexpected parent-child process relationships. While legitimate use cases exist—such as Windows services, software installers, or security tools—unusual or high-frequency anonymous pipe activity should be investigated for potential malware, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement techniques.",

It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. These tools are often used by adversaries to extract usernames, IP addresses, session data, and event information for credential access or situational awareness during lateral movement. While these utilities are legitimate, execution with specific arguments or targeting sensitive logs like `Security`, `PowerShell`, or specific EventIDs (e.g., 4624, 4778) can indicate malicious intent. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to extract sensitive info and potentially have leveraged access or move laterally.\n",

For a SOC, identifying disabled 2FA requirements is critical as it could indicate attempts to weaken account security controls. Two-factor authentication is a fundamental security control that helps prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised. Disabling 2FA requirements could allow attackers to more easily compromise accounts through password-based attacks. The impact of disabled 2FA includes increased risk of account takeover, potential access to sensitive code and intellectual property, and compromise of the software supply chain.

It operates by monitoring CloudTrail logs for specific error codes related to deletion failures. This behavior is significant for a SOC as it may indicate unauthorized attempts to modify access controls or disrupt operations by removing groups. Such actions could be part of a larger attack aiming to escalate privileges or impair security protocols. Identifying these attempts allows for timely investigation and mitigation, preventing potential impact on the organizations security posture.",

The detection monitors GitHub Organizations audit logs for branch ruleset deletion events by tracking actor details, repository information, and associated metadata. For a SOC, identifying deleted branch rulesets is critical as it could indicate attempts to bypass code review requirements and security controls. Branch rulesets are essential security controls that enforce code review, prevent force pushes, and maintain code quality. Disabling these protections could allow malicious actors to directly push unauthorized code changes or backdoors to protected branches. The impact of disabled branch protection includes potential code tampering, bypass of security reviews, introduction of vulnerabilities or malicious code, and compromise of software supply chain integrity. This activity could be part of a larger attack chain where an adversary first disables security controls before attempting to inject malicious code.",

The impact could be severe if vulnerabilities remain unpatched, potentially leading to code execution, data theft, or other compromises through the software supply chain.",

The issue impacts all versions of CrushFTP up to 10.7.1 and 11.1.0 on all supported platforms. It is highly recommended to apply patches immediately to prevent unauthorized access to the system and avoid potential data compromises. The search specifically looks for patterns in the raw log data that match the exploitation attempts, including READ or WRITE actions, and extracts relevant information such as the protocol, session ID, user, IP address, HTTP method, and the URI queried. It then evaluates these logs to confirm traces of exploitation based on the presence of specific keywords and the originating IP address, counting and sorting these events for further analysis.",

These attacks are typically aimed at gaining unauthorized access, exfiltrating sensitive data, or disrupting application functionality.\n\nCisco SecureApp provides real-time detection of these threats by analyzing application-layer events and correlating attack behavior with known vulnerability signatures. This detection methodology helps the Security Operations Center (SOC) by:\n\n* Identifying active exploitation attempts in real-time, allowing for quicker incident response.\n* Categorizing attack severity to prioritize remediation efforts based on risk level.\n* Providing visibility into attacker tactics, including source IP, attack techniques, and affected applications.\n* Generating risk-based scoring and contextual alerts to enhance decision-making within SOC workflows.\n* Helping analysts determine whether an attack was merely an attempt or if it successfully exploited a vulnerability.\n\nBy leveraging this information, SOC teams can proactively mitigate security threats, patch vulnerable applications, and enforce security controls to prevent further exploitation.\n",
