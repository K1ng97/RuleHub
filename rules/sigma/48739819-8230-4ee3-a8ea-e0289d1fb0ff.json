  "description": "This detection uses azureactivity logs (Administrative category) to identify the deletion of an Azure AD Hybrid health AD FS service instance in a tenant.\nA threat actor can create a new AD Health ADFS service and create a fake server to spoof AD FS signing logs.\nThe health AD FS service can then be deleted after it is not longer needed via HTTP requests to Azure.\n",
