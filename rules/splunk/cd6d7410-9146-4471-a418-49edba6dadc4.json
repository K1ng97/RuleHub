  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious modifications to system firewall rules, specifically allowing execution of applications from notable and potentially malicious file paths. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving firewall rule changes. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to bypass firewall restrictions to execute malicious files. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute unauthorized code, potentially leading to further system compromise, data exfiltration, or persistence within the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
