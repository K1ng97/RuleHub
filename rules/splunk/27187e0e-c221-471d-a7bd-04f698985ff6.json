  "description": "The following analytic identifies the creation of a .crmlog file within the %windows%\\Registration directory, typically with a format of <RANDOM_GUID>.<RANDOM_GUID>.crmlog. This detection leverages the Endpoint.Filesystem datamodel to monitor file creation events in the specified directory. This activity is significant as it is associated with the Snake malware, which uses this file for its operations. If confirmed malicious, this could indicate the presence of Snake malware, leading to potential data exfiltration, system compromise, and further malicious activities. Immediate investigation is required to mitigate the threat.",
