  "name": "Powershell Get LocalGroup Discovery with Script Block Logging",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the PowerShell cmdlet `get-localgroup` using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This method captures the full command sent to PowerShell, providing detailed visibility into script execution. Monitoring this activity is significant as it can indicate an attempt to enumerate local groups, which may be a precursor to privilege escalation or lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain insights into group memberships, potentially leading to unauthorized access or privilege abuse. Review parallel processes and the entire script block for comprehensive analysis.",
