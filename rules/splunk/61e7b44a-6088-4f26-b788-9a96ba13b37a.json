  "name": "Detect Rundll32 Application Control Bypass - setupapi",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe loading setupapi.dll and iesetupapi.dll via the LaunchINFSection function. This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process creation events and command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it indicates a potential application control bypass, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary script code. If confirmed malicious, this technique could enable code execution, privilege escalation, or persistence within the environment, posing a severe threat to system integrity and security.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
