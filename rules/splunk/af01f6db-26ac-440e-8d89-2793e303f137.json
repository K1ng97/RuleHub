  "name": "Windows DLL Side-Loading In Calc",
  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious DLL modules loaded by calc.exe that are not located in the %systemroot%\\system32 or %systemroot%\\sysWoW64 directories. This detection leverages Sysmon EventCode 7 to identify DLL side-loading, a technique often used by Qakbot malware to execute malicious DLLs. This activity is significant as it indicates potential malware execution through a trusted process, which can bypass security controls. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, maintain persistence, and escalate privileges within the environment.",
