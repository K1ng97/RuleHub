  "description": "The following analytic identifies the creation of a new kernel mode driver using the sc.exe command. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that include command-line details. The activity is significant because adding a kernel driver is uncommon in regular operations and can indicate an attempt to gain low-level access to the system. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute code with high privileges, potentially compromising the entire system and evading traditional security measures.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
