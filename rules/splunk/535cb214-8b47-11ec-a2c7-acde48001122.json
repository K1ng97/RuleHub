  "description": "The following analytic identifies potential enumeration of local network configuration on Linux systems. It detects this activity by monitoring processes such as \"arp,\" \"ifconfig,\" \"ip,\" \"netstat,\" \"firewall-cmd,\" \"ufw,\" \"iptables,\" \"ss,\" and \"route\" within a 30-minute window. This behavior is significant as it often indicates reconnaissance efforts by adversaries to gather network information for subsequent attacks. If confirmed malicious, this activity could enable attackers to map the network, identify vulnerabilities, and plan further exploitation or lateral movement within the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
