  "description": "The following analytic detects the modification of the Windows registry to disable the Folder Options feature, which prevents users from showing hidden files and file extensions. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, specifically monitoring changes to the registry path \"*\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Policies\\\\Explorer\\\\NoFolderOptions\" with a value of \"0x00000001\". This activity is significant as it is commonly used by malware to conceal malicious files and deceive users with fake file extensions. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to hide their presence and malicious files, making detection and remediation more difficult.",
