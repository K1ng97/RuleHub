  "description": "The following analytic detects changes in a service security descriptor where a new deny ace has been added. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, specifically searching for any process execution involving the \"sc.exe\" binary with the \"sdset\" flag targeting any service and adding a dedicated deny ace. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to escalate their privileges, blind defenses and more.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process name, and process original file name. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
