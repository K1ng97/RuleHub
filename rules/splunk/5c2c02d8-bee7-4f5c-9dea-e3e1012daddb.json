  "name": "Crowdstrike Multiple LOW Severity Alerts",
  "description": "The following analytic detects multiple CrowdStrike LOW severity alerts, indicating a series of minor suspicious activities or policy violations. These alerts are not immediately critical but should be reviewed to prevent potential threats. They often highlight unusual behavior or low-level risks that, if left unchecked, could escalate into more significant security issues. Regular monitoring and analysis of these alerts are essential for maintaining robust security.",
