  "name": "Detect malicious requests to exploit JBoss servers",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies malicious HTTP requests targeting the jmx-console in JBoss servers. It detects unusually long URLs, indicative of embedded payloads, by analyzing web server logs for GET or HEAD requests with specific URL patterns and lengths. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to exploit JBoss vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unauthorized remote code execution. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain control over the server, escalate privileges, and compromise sensitive data, posing a severe threat to the organization's security.",
