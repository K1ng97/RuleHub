  "description": "The following analytic identifies DNS requests with unusually large query lengths for the record type being requested. It leverages the Network_Resolution data model and applies a machine learning model to detect outliers in DNS query lengths. This activity is significant because unusually large DNS queries can indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication attempts. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data or maintain persistent communication channels with compromised systems.",

    "condition": "To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Resolution data model. In addition, the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) version 4.2 or greater must be installed on your search heads, along with any required dependencies. Finally, the support search \"Baseline of DNS Query Length - MLTK\" must be executed before this detection search, because it builds a machine-learning (ML) model over the historical data used by this search. It is important that this search is run in the same app context as the associated support search, so that the model created by the support search is available for use. You should periodically re-run the support search to rebuild the model with the latest data available in your environment.\nThis search produces fields (`query`,`query_length`,`count`) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a finding event is raised. These fields contribute additional context to the finding. To see the additional metadata, add the following fields, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\n * **Label:** DNS Query, **Field:** query\n* **Label:** DNS Query Length, **Field:** query_length\n* **Label:** Number of events, **Field:** count\n",
