  "description": "The following analytic detects a suspicious registry modification aimed at disabling Windows Defender notifications. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, specifically looking for changes to the registry path \"*\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Policies\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows Defender Security Center\\\\Notifications\\\\DisableNotifications\" with a value of \"0x00000001\". This activity is significant as it indicates an attempt to evade detection by disabling security alerts, a technique used by adversaries and malware like RedLine Stealer. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to operate undetected, increasing the risk of further compromise and data exfiltration.",
