  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the taskkill command in a process command line to terminate several known browser processes, a technique commonly employed by the Braodo stealer malware to steal credentials. By forcefully closing browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, the malware can unlock files that store sensitive information, such as passwords and login data. This detection focuses on identifying taskkill commands targeting these browsers, signaling malicious intent. Early detection allows security teams to investigate and prevent further credential theft and system compromise.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
