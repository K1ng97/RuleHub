  "name": "Unusually Long Command Line",
  "description": "The following analytic detects unusually long command lines, which may indicate malicious activity. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on the length of command lines executed on hosts. This behavior is significant because attackers often use obfuscated or complex command lines to evade detection and execute malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to data theft, ransomware deployment, or further system compromise. Analysts should investigate the source and content of the command line, inspect relevant artifacts, and review concurrent processes to identify potential threats.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
