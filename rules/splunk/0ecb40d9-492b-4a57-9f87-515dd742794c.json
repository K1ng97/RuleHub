  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of AutoIt3, a scripting language often used for automating Windows GUI tasks and general scripting. It identifies instances where AutoIt3 or its variants are executed by searching for process names or original file names matching 'autoit3.exe'. This activity is significant because attackers frequently use AutoIt3 to automate malicious actions, such as executing malware. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized code execution, system compromise, or further propagation of malware within the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
