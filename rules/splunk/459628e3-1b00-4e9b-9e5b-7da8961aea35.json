  "name": "Windows Shell Process from CrushFTP",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies instances where CrushFTP's service process (crushftpservice.exe) spawns shell processes like cmd.exe or powershell.exe. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events. This activity is significant because CrushFTP should not normally spawn interactive shell processes during regular operations. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate successful exploitation of vulnerabilities like CVE-2025-31161, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the CrushFTP service.",

These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model.",
