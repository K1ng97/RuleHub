  "name": "Okta Multiple Failed Requests to Access Applications",
  "description": "The following analytic detects multiple failed attempts to access applications in Okta, potentially indicating the reuse of a stolen web session cookie. It leverages Okta logs to evaluate policy and SSO events, aggregating data by user, session, and IP. The detection triggers when more than half of the app sign-on attempts are unsuccessful across multiple applications. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to bypass authentication mechanisms. If confirmed malicious, it could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive applications and data, posing a significant security risk.",
