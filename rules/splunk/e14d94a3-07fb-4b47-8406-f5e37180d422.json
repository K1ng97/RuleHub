  "description": "This analysis detects the use of debugger tools within a production environment. While these tools are legitimate for file analysis and debugging, they are abused by malware like PlugX and DarkGate for malicious DLL side-loading. The hunting query aids Security Operations Centers (SOCs) in identifying potentially suspicious tool executions, particularly for non-technical users in the production network.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
