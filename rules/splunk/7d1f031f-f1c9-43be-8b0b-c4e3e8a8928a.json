  "description": "The following analytic detects registry changes to the default file association value. It leverages data from the Endpoint data model, specifically monitoring registry paths under \"HKCR\\\\*\\\\shell\\\\open\\\\command\\\\*\". This activity can be significant because, attackers might alter the default file associations in order to execute arbitrary scripts or payloads when a user opens a file, leading to potential code execution. If confirmed malicious, this technique can enable attackers to persist on the compromised host and execute further malicious commands, posing a severe threat to the environment.",
