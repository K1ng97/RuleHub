  "description": "The following analytic detects multiple attempts to stop or delete services on a system using `net.exe` or `sc.exe`. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process names and command-line executions within a one-minute window. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to disable security or critical services to evade detection and further their objectives. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to the attacker gaining persistence, escalating privileges, or disrupting essential services, thereby compromising the system's security posture.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
