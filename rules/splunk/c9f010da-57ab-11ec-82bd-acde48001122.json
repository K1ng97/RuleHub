  "name": "Windows Raccine Scheduled Task Deletion",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies the deletion of the Raccine Rules Updater scheduled task using the `schtasks.exe` command. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant because adversaries may delete this task to disable Raccine, a tool designed to prevent ransomware attacks. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow ransomware to execute without interference, leading to potential data encryption and loss.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
