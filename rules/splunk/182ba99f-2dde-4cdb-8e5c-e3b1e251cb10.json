  "name": "Windows SQL Server Extended Procedure DLL Loading Hunt",
  "description": "This analytic detects when SQL Server loads DLLs to execute extended stored procedures. This is particularly important for security monitoring as it indicates the first-time use or version changes of potentially dangerous procedures like xp_cmdshell, sp_OACreate, and others. While this is a legitimate operation, adversaries may abuse these procedures for execution, discovery, or privilege escalation.",
