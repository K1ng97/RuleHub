  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the deprecated 'pkgmgr.exe' process with an XML input file, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process execution details and command-line arguments. The significance lies in the deprecated status of 'pkgmgr.exe' and the use of XML files, which could indicate an attempt to bypass User Account Control (UAC). If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to execute commands with elevated privileges, leading to potential system compromise and unauthorized changes.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
