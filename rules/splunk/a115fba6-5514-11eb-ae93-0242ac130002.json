  "description": "The following analytic identifies instances where wmiprvse.exe spawns msbuild.exe, which is unusual and indicative of potential misuse of a COM object. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process relationships and command-line executions. This activity is significant because msbuild.exe is typically spawned by devenv.exe during legitimate Visual Studio use, not by wmiprvse.exe. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate an attacker executing arbitrary code or scripts, potentially leading to system compromise or further malicious activities.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
