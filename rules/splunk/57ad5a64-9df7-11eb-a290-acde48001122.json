  "name": "Windows Multiple Invalid Users Failed To Authenticate Using NTLM",
  "description": "The following analytic detects a single source endpoint failing to authenticate with 30 unique invalid users using the NTLM protocol. It leverages EventCode 4776 from Domain Controller logs, focusing on error code 0xC0000064, which indicates non-existent usernames. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of sensitive information within the Active Directory environment.",
