  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of `powershell.exe` running the `Get-ADUserResultantPasswordPolicy` cmdlet, which is used to obtain the password policy in a Windows domain. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it indicates potential enumeration of domain policies, a common tactic for situational awareness and Active Directory discovery by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to understand password policies, aiding in further attacks such as password spraying or brute force attempts.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
