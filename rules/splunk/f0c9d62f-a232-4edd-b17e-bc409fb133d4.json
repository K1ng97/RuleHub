  "name": "Domain Group Discovery With Dsquery",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies the execution of `dsquery.exe` with command-line arguments used to query for domain groups. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because both Red Teams and adversaries use `dsquery.exe` to enumerate domain groups, gaining situational awareness and facilitating further Active Directory discovery. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to map out the domain structure, identify high-value targets, and plan subsequent attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation or data exfiltration.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
