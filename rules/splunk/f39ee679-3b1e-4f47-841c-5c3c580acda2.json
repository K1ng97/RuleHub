  "name": "Windows DLL Search Order Hijacking with iscsicpl",
  "description": "The following analytic detects DLL search order hijacking involving iscsicpl.exe. It identifies when iscsicpl.exe loads a malicious DLL from a new path, triggering the payload execution. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on child processes spawned by iscsicpl.exe. This activity is significant as it indicates a potential attempt to execute unauthorized code via DLL hijacking. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
