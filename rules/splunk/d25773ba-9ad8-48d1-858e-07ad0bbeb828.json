  "description": "The following analytic identifies spikes in the number of Server Message Block (SMB) connections using the Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK). It leverages the Network_Traffic data model to monitor SMB traffic on ports 139 and 445, applying a machine learning model to detect anomalies. This activity is significant because sudden increases in SMB traffic can indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts by attackers. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, or further compromise of the network.",

    "condition": "To successfully implement this search, you will need to ensure that DNS data is populating the Network_Traffic data model. In addition, the latest version of Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK) must be installed on your search heads, along with any required dependencies. Finally, the support search \"Baseline of SMB Traffic - MLTK\" must be executed before this detection search, because it builds a machine-learning (ML) model over the historical data used by this search. It is important that this search is run in the same app context as the associated support search, so that the model created by the support search is available for use. You should periodically re-run the support search to rebuild the model with the latest data available in your environment.\nThis search produces a field (Number of events,count) that are not yet supported by ES Incident Review and therefore cannot be viewed when a finding is raised. This field contributes additional context to the finding. To see the additional metadata, add the following field, if not already present, to Incident Review - Event Attributes (Configure > Incident Management > Incident Review Settings > Add New Entry):\n* **Label:** Number of events, **Field:** count",
