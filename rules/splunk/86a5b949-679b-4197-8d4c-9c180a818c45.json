  "description": "The following analytic identifies the execution of `net.exe` with command-line arguments used to list or display information about computer connections. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity can be significant as it indicates potential network reconnaissance by adversaries or Red Teams, aiming to gather situational awareness and Active Directory information. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to map the network, identify critical assets, and plan further attacks, potentially leading to data exfiltration or lateral movement.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
