  "description": "The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for non-admin accounts with duplicate password risk, identifying instances where multiple non-admin users share the same password. This practice weakens security and increases the potential for unauthorized access. Addressing these alerts is essential to ensure each user account has a unique, strong password, thereby enhancing overall security and protecting sensitive information.",
