  "name": "Windows Multiple Users Failed To Authenticate From Host Using NTLM",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies a single source endpoint failing to authenticate with 30 unique valid users using the NTLM protocol. It leverages EventCode 4776 from Domain Controller logs, focusing on error code 0xC000006A, which indicates a bad password. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information or further compromise of the Active Directory environment.",
