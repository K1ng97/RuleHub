  "name": "Linux Auditd File Permission Modification Via Chmod",
  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious file permission modifications using the `chmod` command, which may indicate an attacker attempting to alter access controls on critical files or directories. Such modifications can be used to grant unauthorized users elevated privileges or to conceal malicious activities by restricting legitimate access. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized `chmod` usage, this analytic helps identify potential security breaches, allowing security teams to respond promptly to prevent privilege escalation, data tampering, or other unauthorized actions on the system.",

    "condition": "To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed",
