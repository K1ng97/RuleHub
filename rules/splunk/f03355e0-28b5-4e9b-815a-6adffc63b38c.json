  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of rundll32.exe with command-line arguments loading davclnt.dll and the davsetcookie function to access a remote WebDav instance. It uses data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, correlating process execution and network traffic data. This activity is significant as it may indicate exploitation of CVE-2023-23397, a known vulnerability. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to establish unauthorized remote connections, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further network compromise.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
