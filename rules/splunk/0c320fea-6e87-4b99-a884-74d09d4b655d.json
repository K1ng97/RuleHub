  "name": "Linux Auditd Osquery Service Stop",
  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious stopping of the `osquery` service, which may indicate an attempt to disable monitoring and evade detection. `Osquery` is a powerful tool used for querying system information and detecting anomalies, and stopping its service can be a sign that an attacker is trying to disrupt security monitoring or hide malicious activities. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized stops of the `osquery` service, this analytic helps identify potential efforts to bypass security controls, enabling security teams to investigate and respond to possible threats effectively.",

    "condition": "To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed",
