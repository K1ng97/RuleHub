  "name": "Windows Default Group Policy Object Modified with GPME",
  "description": "The following analytic detects modifications to default Group Policy Objects (GPOs) using the Group Policy Management Editor (GPME). It leverages the Endpoint data model to identify processes where `mmc.exe` executes `gpme.msc` with specific GUIDs related to default GPOs. This activity is significant because default GPOs, such as the `Default Domain Controllers Policy` and `Default Domain Policy`, are critical for enforcing security policies across the domain. If malicious, such modifications could allow an attacker to gain further access, establish persistence, or deploy malware across numerous hosts, severely compromising the network's security.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
