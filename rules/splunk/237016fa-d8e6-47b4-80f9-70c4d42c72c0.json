  "description": "The following analytic identifies processes running from file paths within the ProgramData directory, a common location abused by adversaries for executing malicious code while evading detection. Threat actors often drop and execute payloads from this directory to bypass security controls, as it typically has write permissions for standard users. While this behavior can indicate malware execution or persistence techniques, it is important to note that some legitimate software, installers, and update mechanisms also run from ProgramData, leading to potential false positives. Security teams should validate detections by correlating with other indicators, such as unusual parent processes, unsigned binaries, or anomalous network activity.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
