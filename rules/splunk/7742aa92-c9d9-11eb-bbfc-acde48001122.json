  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of \"bcdedit.exe\" with parameters to set the boot status policy to ignore all failures. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because it can indicate an attempt by ransomware to prevent a compromised machine from booting into automatic repair mode, thereby hindering recovery efforts. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to maintain control over the infected system, complicating remediation and potentially leading to further damage.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
