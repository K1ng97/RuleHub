  "description": "The following analytic identifies the execution of msdtc.exe with specific command-line parameters (-a or -b), which are indicative of the PlugX malware. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because PlugX uses these parameters to masquerade its malicious operations within legitimate processes, making it harder to detect. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access, exfiltrate data, and conduct espionage, severely compromising the affected system.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
