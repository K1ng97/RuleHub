  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the sfc.exe utility with the \"-u\" parameter, which is part of the Cisco Secure Endpoint installation. The \"-u\" flag allows the uninstallation of Cisco Secure Endpoint components. This detection leverages endpoint telemetry to monitor command-line executions that include the \"-u\" parameter. The use of this flag is significant as it could indicate an attempt to disable or remove endpoint protection, potentially leaving the system vulnerable to further exploitation. If identified as malicious, this action may be part of a broader effort to disable security mechanisms and avoid detection.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
