  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the sfc.exe utility with the \"-unblock\" parameter, a feature within Cisco Secure Endpoint. The \"-unblock\" flag is used to remove system blocks imposed by the endpoint protection. This detection focuses on command-line activity that includes the \"-unblock\" parameter, as it may indicate an attempt to restore access to files or processes previously blocked by the security software. While this action could be legitimate in troubleshooting scenarios, malicious actors might use it to override protective measures, enabling execution of blocked malicious payloads or bypassing other security mechanisms.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
