  "name": "Windows Multiple Users Failed To Authenticate Using Kerberos",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies a single source endpoint failing to authenticate with 30 unique users using the Kerberos protocol. It leverages EventCode 4771 with Status 0x18, indicating wrong password attempts, and aggregates these events over a 5-minute window. This behavior is significant as it may indicate a Password Spraying attack, where an adversary attempts to gain initial access or elevate privileges in an Active Directory environment. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of sensitive information.",
