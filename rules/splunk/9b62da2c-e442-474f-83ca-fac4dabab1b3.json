  "description": "The following analytic detects the removal of permission inheritance using ICACLS. This analytic identifies instances where ICACLS is used to remove permission inheritance from files or directories. The /inheritance:r flag, which strips inherited permissions while optionally preserving or altering explicit permissions, is monitored to detect changes that may restrict access or establish isolated permission configurations. Removing inheritance can be a legitimate administrative action but may also indicate an attempt to conceal malicious activity or bypass inherited security controls.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
