  "name": "Windows Impair Defense Delete Win Defender Context Menu",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the deletion of the Windows Defender context menu entry from the registry. It leverages data from the Endpoint datamodel, specifically monitoring registry actions where the path includes \"*\\\\shellex\\\\ContextMenuHandlers\\\\EPP\" and the action is 'deleted'. This activity is significant as it is commonly associated with Remote Access Trojan (RAT) malware attempting to disable security features. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to impair defenses, facilitating further malicious activities such as unauthorized access, persistence, and data exfiltration.",
