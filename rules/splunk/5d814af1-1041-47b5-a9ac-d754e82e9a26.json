  "name": "Process Creating LNK file in Suspicious Location",
  "description": "The following analytic detects a process creating a `.lnk` file in suspicious locations such as `C:\\User*` or `*\\Local\\Temp\\*`. It leverages filesystem and process activity data from the Endpoint data model to identify this behavior. This activity is significant because creating `.lnk` files in these directories is a common tactic used by spear phishing tools to establish persistence or execute malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to maintain persistence, execute arbitrary code, or further compromise the system.",
