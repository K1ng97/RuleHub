  "description": "The following analytic detects the enabling of permission inheritance using ICACLS. This analytic identifies instances where ICACLS commands are used to enable permission inheritance on files or directories. The /inheritance:e flag, which restores inherited permissions from a parent directory, is monitored to detect changes that might reapply broader access control settings. Enabling inheritance can indicate legitimate administrative actions but may also signal attempts to override restrictive custom permissions, potentially exposing sensitive files to unauthorized access.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
