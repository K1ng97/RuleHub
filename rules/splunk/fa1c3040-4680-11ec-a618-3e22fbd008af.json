  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of PowerShell commands that initiate a process on a remote endpoint via the DCOM protocol. It leverages PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104) to identify the use of ShellExecute and ExecuteShellCommand. This activity is significant as it may indicate lateral movement or remote code execution attempts by adversaries. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on remote systems, potentially leading to further compromise and persistence within the network.",
