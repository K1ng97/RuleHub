  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of mavinject.exe for DLL injection into running processes, identified by specific command-line parameters such as /INJECTRUNNING and /HMODULE. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant because it indicates potential arbitrary code execution, a common tactic for malware deployment and persistence. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute unauthorized code, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence within the environment, posing a severe security risk.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
