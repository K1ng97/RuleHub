  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of odbcconf.exe with the regsvr action to load a DLL. This is identified by monitoring command-line arguments in process creation logs from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary code via DLL loading, a common technique used in various attack vectors. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute code with the privileges of the odbcconf.exe process, potentially leading to system compromise or further lateral movement.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
