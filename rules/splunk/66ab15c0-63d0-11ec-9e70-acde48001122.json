  "name": "Linux Common Process For Elevation Control",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies the execution of common Linux processes used for elevation control, such as `chmod`, `chown`, and `setuid`. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant because these processes are often abused by adversaries to gain persistence or escalate privileges on compromised hosts. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to modify file attributes, change file ownership, or set user IDs, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over critical system resources.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
