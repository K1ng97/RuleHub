  "description": "The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry that disable the Windows Defender Scan On Update feature. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry datamodel, specifically looking for changes to the \"DisableScanOnUpdate\" registry setting with a value of \"0x00000001\". This activity is significant because disabling automatic scans can leave systems vulnerable to malware and other threats. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to bypass Windows Defender, facilitating further compromise and persistence within the environment.",
