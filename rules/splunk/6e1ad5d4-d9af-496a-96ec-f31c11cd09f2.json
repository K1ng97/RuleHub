  "description": "The following analytic identifies modifications to specific Outlook registry values related to WebView and Today features. It detects when a URL is set in these registry locations, which could indicate attempts to manipulate Outlook's web-based components. The analytic focuses on changes to the \"URL\" value within Outlook's WebView and Today registry paths. This activity is significant as it may represent an attacker's effort to redirect Outlook's web content or inject malicious URLs. If successful, this technique could lead to phishing attempts, data theft, or serve as a stepping stone for further compromise of the user's email client and potentially sensitive information.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
