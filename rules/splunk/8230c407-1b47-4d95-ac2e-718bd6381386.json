  "name": "Linux Auditd Setuid Using Chmod Utility",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the chmod utility to set the SUID or SGID bit on files, which can allow users to temporarily gain root or group-level access. This detection leverages data from Linux Auditd, focusing on process names and command-line arguments related to chmod. This activity is significant as it can indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or maintain persistence on a system. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain elevated access, potentially compromising sensitive data or critical system functions.",

    "condition": "To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consist SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed",
