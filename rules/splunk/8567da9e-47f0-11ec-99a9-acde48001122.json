  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of `dism.exe` to remove Windows Defender. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include specific parameters for disabling and removing Windows Defender. This activity is significant because adversaries may disable Defender to evade detection and carry out further malicious actions undetected. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to the attacker gaining persistent access, executing additional payloads, or exfiltrating sensitive data without being intercepted by Windows Defender.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
