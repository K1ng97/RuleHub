  "description": "The following analytic detects potential unauthorized access attempts exploiting CVE-2023-35082 within Ivanti's software products. It identifies access to the specific URI path /mifs/asfV3/api/v2/ with an HTTP 200 response code in web access logs, indicating successful unauthorized access. This activity is significant for a SOC as it highlights potential security breaches that could lead to unauthorized data access or system modifications. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain unbridled access to sensitive organizational data or modify systems maliciously, posing severe security risks.",

    "Similar to CVE-2023-35078, the path for exploitation indicates that status=200 is required for successful exploitation of the vulnerability. False positives may be present if status=200 is removed from the search.  If it is removed,then the search also alert on status=301 and status=404 which indicates unsuccessful exploitation attempts.  Analysts may find it useful to hunt for these status codes as well, but it is likely to produce a significant number of alerts as this is a widespread vulnerability."
