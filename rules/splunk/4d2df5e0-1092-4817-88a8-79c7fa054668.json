  "name": "ASL AWS Multi-Factor Authentication Disabled",
  "description": "The following analytic detects attempts to disable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for an AWS IAM user. It leverages Amazon Security Lake logs, specifically monitoring for `DeleteVirtualMFADevice` or `DeactivateMFADevice` API operations. This activity is significant as disabling MFA can indicate an adversary attempting to weaken account security to maintain persistence using a compromised account. If confirmed malicious, this action could allow attackers to retain access to the AWS environment without detection, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive resources and prolonged compromise.",
