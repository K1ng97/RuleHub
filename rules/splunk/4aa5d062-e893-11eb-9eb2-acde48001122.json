  "description": "The following analytic detects a suspicious mshta.exe process spawning rundll32 or regsvr32 child processes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process GUID, process name, and parent process fields. This activity is significant as it is a known technique used by malware like Trickbot to load malicious DLLs and execute payloads. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or download additional malware, posing a severe threat to the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
