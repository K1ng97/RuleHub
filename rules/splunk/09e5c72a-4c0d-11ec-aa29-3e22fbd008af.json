  "description": "The following analytic detects instances of 'svchost.exe' spawning Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS) processes. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data to monitor child processes of 'svchost.exe' that match known LOLBAS executables. This activity is significant as adversaries often use LOLBAS techniques to execute malicious code stealthily, potentially indicating lateral movement or code execution attempts. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment, posing a significant security risk.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
