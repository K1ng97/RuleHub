  "name": "Kubernetes Abuse of Secret by Unusual User Group",
  "description": "The following analytic detects unauthorized access or misuse of Kubernetes Secrets by unusual user groups. It leverages Kubernetes Audit logs to identify anomalies in access patterns by analyzing the source of requests and user groups. This activity is significant for a SOC as Kubernetes Secrets store sensitive information like passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could indicate an attacker attempting to exfiltrate or misuse these secrets, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive systems or data.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities. Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server. Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md. When you want to use this detection with AWS EKS, you need to enable EKS control plane logging https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html. Then you can collect the logs from Cloudwatch using the AWS TA https://splunk.github.io/splunk-add-on-for-amazon-web-services/CloudWatchLogs/.",
