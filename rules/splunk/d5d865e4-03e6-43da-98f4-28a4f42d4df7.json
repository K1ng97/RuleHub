  "description": "The following analytic detects potential exploitation attempts against VMWare vRealize Network Insight, specifically targeting the CVE-2023-20887 vulnerability. It monitors web traffic for HTTP POST requests directed at the vulnerable endpoint \"/saas./resttosaasservlet.\" This detection leverages web traffic data, focusing on specific URL patterns and HTTP methods. Identifying this behavior is crucial for a SOC as it indicates an active exploit attempt. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could execute arbitrary code, leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further network compromise.",
