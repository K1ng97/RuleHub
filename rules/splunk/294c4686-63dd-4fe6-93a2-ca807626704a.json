  "description": "The following analytic detects unauthenticated requests to an Amazon EKS Kubernetes cluster, specifically identifying actions by the \"system:anonymous\" user. It leverages AWS CloudWatch Logs data, focusing on user agents and authentication details. This activity is significant as it may indicate unauthorized scanning or probing of the Kubernetes cluster, which could be a precursor to an attack. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or disruption of services within the Kubernetes environment.",
