  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious creation of hidden files and directories, which may indicate an attacker's attempt to conceal malicious activities or unauthorized data. Hidden files and directories are often used to evade detection by security tools and administrators, providing a stealthy means for storing malware, logs, or sensitive information. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized creation of hidden files and directories, this analytic helps identify potential attempts to hide or unauthorized creation of hidden files and directories, this analytic helps identify potential attempts to hide malicious operations, enabling security teams to uncover and address hidden threats effectively.",

    "condition": "To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed",
