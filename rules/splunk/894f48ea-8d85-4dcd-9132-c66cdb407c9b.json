  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the Apache Benchmark binary (ab.exe), commonly used by MetaSploit payloads. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events where the original file name is ab.exe. This activity is significant as it may indicate the presence of a MetaSploit attack, which uses Apache Benchmark to generate malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized network connections, further system compromise, and potential data exfiltration. Immediate investigation is required to determine the intent and scope of the activity.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
