  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of msbuild.exe from a non-standard path. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs that deviate from typical msbuild.exe locations. This activity is significant because msbuild.exe is commonly abused by attackers to execute malicious code, and running it from an unusual path can indicate an attempt to evade detection. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise and further malicious activities.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
