  "description": "The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for privilege escalation attempts by non-admin users. These alerts indicate unauthorized efforts by regular users to gain elevated permissions, posing a significant security risk. Detecting and addressing these attempts promptly helps prevent potential breaches and ensures that user privileges remain properly managed, maintaining the integrity of the organization's security protocols.",
