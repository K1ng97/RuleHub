  "name": "Malicious PowerShell Process With Obfuscation Techniques",
  "description": "The following analytic detects PowerShell processes launched with command-line arguments indicative of obfuscation techniques. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent processes, and complete command-line executions. This activity is significant because obfuscated PowerShell commands are often used by attackers to evade detection and execute malicious scripts. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access within the environment, posing a significant security risk.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
