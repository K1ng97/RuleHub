  "name": "Linux Auditd Virtual Disk File And Directory Discovery",
  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious discovery of virtual disk files and directories, which may indicate an attacker's attempt to locate and access virtualized storage environments. Virtual disks can contain sensitive data or critical system configurations, and unauthorized discovery attempts could signify preparatory actions for data exfiltration or further compromise. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized searches for virtual disk files and directories, this analytic helps identify potential reconnaissance activities, enabling security teams to respond promptly and safeguard against unauthorized access and data breaches.",

    "condition": "To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed",
