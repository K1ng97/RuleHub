  "description": "The following analytic detects attempts to exploit a remote code execution vulnerability in Juniper Networks devices. It identifies requests to /webauth_operation.php?PHPRC=*, which are indicative of uploading and executing malicious PHP files. This detection leverages the Web data model, focusing on specific URL patterns and HTTP status codes. This activity is significant because it signals an attempt to gain unauthorized access and execute arbitrary code on the device. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could gain control over the device, leading to data theft, network compromise, or other severe consequences.",
