  "description": "The following analytic identifies the execution of rundll32.exe with command-line arguments loading davclnt.dll and the davsetcookie function to access a remote WebDAV instance. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to exploit CVE-2023-23397, a known vulnerability. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute remote code or exfiltrate data, posing a severe threat to the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
