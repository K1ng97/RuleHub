  "description": "The following analytic detects the spawning of cmd or PowerShell processes by the wermgr.exe process. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process telemetry, including parent-child process relationships and command-line executions. This behavior is significant as it is commonly associated with code injection techniques used by malware like TrickBot to execute shellcode or malicious DLL modules. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the environment, posing a severe threat to system security.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
