  "description": "The following analytic detects CrowdStrike alerts for High Identity Risk Severity with a risk score of 70 or higher. These alerts indicate significant vulnerabilities in user identities, such as suspicious behavior or compromised credentials. Promptly investigating and addressing these alerts is crucial to prevent potential security breaches and ensure the integrity and protection of sensitive information and systems.",
