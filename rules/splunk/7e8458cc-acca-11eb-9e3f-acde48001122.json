  "name": "Modify ACL permission To Files Or Folder",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the modification of ACL permissions to files or folders, making them accessible to everyone or to system account. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on processes like \"cacls.exe,\" \"icacls.exe,\" and \"xcacls.exe\" with specific command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to evade ACLs or access protected files. If confirmed malicious, this could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to data breaches or further system compromise.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
