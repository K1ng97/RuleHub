  "description": "The following analytic detects the modification of a firewall rule to allow the execution of a specific application. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events with command-line arguments related to firewall rule changes. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to bypass firewall restrictions, potentially allowing unauthorized applications to communicate over the network. If confirmed malicious, this could enable an attacker to execute arbitrary code, escalate privileges, or maintain persistence within the target environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
