  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious attempts to find private keys, which may indicate an attacker's effort to access sensitive cryptographic information. Private keys are crucial for securing encrypted communications and data, and unauthorized access to them can lead to severe security breaches, including data decryption and identity theft. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized searches for private keys, this analytic helps identify potential threats to cryptographic security, enabling security teams to take swift action to protect the integrity and confidentiality of encrypted information.",

    "condition": "To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed",
