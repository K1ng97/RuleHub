  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of gpupdate.exe without any command line arguments. This behavior is identified using data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. It is significant because gpupdate.exe typically runs with specific arguments, and its execution without them is often associated with malicious activities, such as those performed by Cobalt Strike. If confirmed malicious, this activity could indicate an attempt to execute unauthorized commands or scripts, potentially leading to further system compromise or lateral movement within the network.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
