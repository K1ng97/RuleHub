  "description": "The following analytic identifies when an O365 email account hard deletes an excessive number of emails within a short period (within 1 hour). This behavior may indicate a compromised account where the threat actor is attempting to permanently purge a large amount of items from the mailbox. Threat actors may attempt to remove evidence of their activity by purging items from the compromised mailbox. --- Some account owner legitimate behaviors can trigger this alert, however these actions may not be aligned with organizational expectations / best practice behaviors.",
