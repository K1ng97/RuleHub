  "name": "Excessive Usage Of Cacls App",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies excessive usage of `cacls.exe`, `xcacls.exe`, or `icacls.exe` to change file or folder permissions. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may indicate an adversary attempting to restrict access to malware components or artifacts on a compromised system. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could prevent users from deleting or accessing critical files, aiding in the persistence and concealment of malicious activities.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
