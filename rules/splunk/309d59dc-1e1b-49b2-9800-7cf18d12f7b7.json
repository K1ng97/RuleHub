  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious command-line activity that modifies the iptables firewall settings on a Linux machine. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command patterns that alter firewall rules to accept traffic on certain TCP ports. This activity is significant as it can indicate malware, such as CyclopsBlink, modifying firewall settings to allow communication with a Command and Control (C2) server. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to maintain persistent access and exfiltrate data, posing a severe security risk.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
