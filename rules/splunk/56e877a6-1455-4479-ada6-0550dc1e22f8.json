  "name": "Email Attachments With Lots Of Spaces",
  "description": "The following analytic detects email attachments with an unusually high number of spaces in their file names, which is a common tactic used by attackers to obfuscate file extensions. It leverages the Email data model to identify attachments where the ratio of spaces to the total file name length exceeds 10%. This behavior is significant as it may indicate an attempt to bypass security filters and deliver malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to the execution of harmful code or unauthorized access to sensitive information within the recipient's environment.",

The threshold ratio is set to 10%, but this value can be configured to suit each environment.\n**Splunk Phantom Playbook Integration**\nIf Splunk Phantom is also configured in your environment, a playbook called \"Suspicious Email Attachment Investigate and Delete\" can be configured to run when any results are found by this detection search. To use this integration, install the Phantom App for Splunk `https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3411/` and add the correct hostname to the \"Phantom Instance\" field in the Adaptive Response Actions when configuring this detection search. The finding based event will be sent to Phantom and the playbook will gather further information about the file attachment and its network behaviors. If Phantom finds malicious behavior and an analyst approves of the results, the email will be deleted from the user's inbox.",
