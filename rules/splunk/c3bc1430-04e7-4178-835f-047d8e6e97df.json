  "name": "Detect Regasm with no Command Line Arguments",
  "description": "The following analytic detects instances of regasm.exe running without command line arguments. This behavior typically indicates process injection, where another process manipulates regasm.exe. The detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may signal an attempt to evade detection or execute malicious code. If confirmed malicious, attackers could achieve code execution, potentially leading to privilege escalation, persistence, or access to sensitive information. Investigate network connections, parallel processes, and suspicious module loads for further context.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
