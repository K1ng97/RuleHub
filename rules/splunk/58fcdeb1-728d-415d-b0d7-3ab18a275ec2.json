  "description": "The following analytic detects path traversal command-line execution, often used in malicious documents to execute code via msdt.exe for defense evasion. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on specific patterns in process paths. This activity is significant as it can indicate an attempt to bypass security controls and execute unauthorized code. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to code execution, privilege escalation, or persistence within the environment, potentially allowing attackers to deploy malware or leverage other living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins).",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
