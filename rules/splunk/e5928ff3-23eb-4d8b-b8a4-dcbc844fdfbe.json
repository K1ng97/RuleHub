  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of `fltMC.exe` to unload the Sysmon driver, which stops Sysmon from collecting data. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant because disabling Sysmon can blind security monitoring, allowing malicious actions to go undetected. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to execute further attacks without being logged, leading to potential data breaches, privilege escalation, or persistent access within the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
