  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of certutil to download software, specifically when spawned by SQL-related processes. This detection leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on command-line executions involving certutil with parameters like *urlcache* and *split*. This activity is significant as it may indicate a compromise by threat actors, such as Flax Typhoon, who use certutil to establish persistent VPN connections. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to maintain access, monitor system availability, and potentially escalate to data theft or ransomware deployment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
