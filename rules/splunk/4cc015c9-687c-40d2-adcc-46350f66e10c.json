  "description": "The following analytic detects the loading of the mshtml.dll module into an Office product, which is indicative of CVE-2021-40444 exploitation. It leverages Sysmon EventID 7 to monitor image loads by specific Office processes. This activity is significant because it can indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability in the MSHTML component via a malicious document. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further network penetration.",
