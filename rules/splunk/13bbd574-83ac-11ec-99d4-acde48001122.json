  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of Mimikatz command line parameters associated with pass-the-ticket attacks. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line patterns related to Kerberos ticket manipulation. This activity is significant because pass-the-ticket attacks allow adversaries to move laterally within an environment using stolen Kerberos tickets, bypassing normal access controls. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to escalate privileges, access sensitive information, and maintain persistence within the network.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
