  "name": "Execution of File with Multiple Extensions",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of files with multiple extensions, such as \".doc.exe\" or \".pdf.exe\". This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on process creation events where the file name contains double extensions. This activity is significant because attackers often use double extensions to disguise malicious executables as benign documents, increasing the likelihood of user execution. If confirmed malicious, this technique can lead to unauthorized code execution, potentially compromising the endpoint and allowing further malicious activities.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
