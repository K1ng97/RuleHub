  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of Certify or Certipy tools to enumerate Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) environments. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on specific command-line arguments associated with these tools. This activity is significant because it indicates potential reconnaissance or exploitation attempts targeting AD CS, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. If confirmed malicious, attackers could gain insights into the AD CS infrastructure, potentially compromising sensitive certificates and escalating their privileges within the network.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
