  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of msiexec.exe with the /z switch parameter, which is used to unload DLLRegisterServer. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs, including command-line arguments. This activity is significant because unloading DLLRegisterServer can be indicative of an attempt to deregister a DLL, potentially disrupting legitimate services or hiding malicious activity. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to disable security controls, evade detection, or disrupt system functionality, leading to further compromise of the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
