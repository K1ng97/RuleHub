  "name": "Windows Post Exploitation Risk Behavior",
  "description": "The following analytic identifies four or more distinct post-exploitation behaviors on a Windows system. It leverages data from the Risk data model in Splunk Enterprise Security, focusing on multiple risk events and their associated MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques. This activity is significant as it indicates potential malicious actions following an initial compromise, such as persistence, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to maintain control, escalate privileges, and further exploit the compromised environment, leading to significant security breaches and data loss.",
