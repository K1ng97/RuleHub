  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the SubInAcl utility. SubInAcl is a legacy Windows Resource Kit tool from the Windows 2003 era, used to manipulate security descriptors of securable objects. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, specifically searching for any process execution involving \"SubInAcl.exe\" binary. This activity can be significant because the utility should be rarely found on modern Windows machines, which mean any execution could potentially be considered suspicious. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to blind defenses by tampering with EventLog ACLs or modifying the access to a previously denied resource.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process name, and process original file name. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
