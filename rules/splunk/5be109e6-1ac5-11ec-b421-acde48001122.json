  "description": "The following analytic detects the creation of .wav files in the AppData folder, a behavior associated with Remcos RAT malware, which stores audio recordings in this location for data exfiltration. The detection leverages endpoint process and filesystem data to identify .wav file creation within the AppData\\Roaming directory. This activity is significant as it indicates potential unauthorized data collection and exfiltration by malware. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to sensitive information being sent to an attacker's command and control server, compromising the affected system's confidentiality.",
