  "description": "The following analytic detects the creation of a suspicious registry entry by Qakbot malware, characterized by 8 random registry value names with encrypted binary data. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on registry modifications under the \"SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\\" path by processes like explorer.exe. This activity is significant as it indicates potential Qakbot infection, which uses the registry to store malicious code or configuration data. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain persistence and execute arbitrary code on the compromised system.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
