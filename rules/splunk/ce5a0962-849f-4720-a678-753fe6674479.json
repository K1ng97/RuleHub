  "description": "The following analytic detects instances where network traffic, identified by port and transport layer protocol as prohibited in the \"lookup_interesting_ports\" table, is allowed. It uses the Network_Traffic data model to cross-reference traffic data against predefined security policies. This activity is significant for a SOC as it highlights potential misconfigurations or policy violations that could lead to unauthorized access or data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to bypass network defenses, leading to potential data breaches and compromising the organization's security posture.",
