  "description": "The following analytic detects the potential abuse of the verclsid.exe utility to execute malicious files via generated CLSIDs. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line patterns associated with verclsid.exe. This activity is significant because verclsid.exe is a legitimate Windows application used to verify CLSID COM objects, and its misuse can indicate an attempt to bypass security controls. If confirmed malicious, this technique could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise or further malicious activities.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
