  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the RDPWInst.exe tool, which is an RDP wrapper library used to enable remote desktop host support and concurrent RDP sessions. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, original file names, and specific command-line arguments. This activity is significant because adversaries can abuse this tool to establish unauthorized RDP connections, facilitating remote access and potential lateral movement within the network. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and further compromise of the targeted host.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
