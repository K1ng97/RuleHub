  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the Windows OS tool cmdkey.exe, which is used to create stored usernames, passwords, or credentials. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because cmdkey.exe is often abused by post-exploitation tools and malware, such as Darkgate, to gain unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to escalate privileges and maintain persistence on the targeted host, facilitating further attacks and potential data breaches.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
