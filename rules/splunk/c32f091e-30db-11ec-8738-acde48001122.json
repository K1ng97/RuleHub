  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of Windows Curl.exe to download a file to a suspicious location, such as AppData, ProgramData, or Public directories. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include the -O or --output options. This activity is significant because downloading files to these locations can indicate an attempt to bypass security controls or establish persistence. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the system.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
