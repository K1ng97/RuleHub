  "name": "Detect Rundll32 Inline HTA Execution",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of \"rundll32.exe\" with inline protocol handlers such as \"JavaScript\", \"VBScript\", and \"About\". This behavior is identified using Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line arguments. This activity is significant as it is often associated with fileless malware or application whitelisting bypass techniques. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, bypass security controls, and maintain persistence within the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
