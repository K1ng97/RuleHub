  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the 'rmdir' command with '/s' and '/q' options to delete files and directory trees. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process metadata. This activity is significant as it may indicate malware attempting to remove traces or components during cleanup operations. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to eliminate forensic evidence, hinder incident response efforts, and maintain persistence by removing indicators of compromise.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
