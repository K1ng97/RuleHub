  "name": "Linux Obfuscated Files or Information Base64 Decode",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the base64 decode command on Linux systems, which is often used to deobfuscate files. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions that include \"base64 -d\" or \"base64 --decode\". This activity is significant as it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious payloads or scripts. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could use this technique to execute hidden code, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
