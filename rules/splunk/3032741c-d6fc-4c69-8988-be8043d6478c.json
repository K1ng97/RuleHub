  "description": "The following analytic detects a modification in the Windows registry that disables the Windows Defender Controlled Folder Access feature. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, specifically monitoring changes to the EnableControlledFolderAccess registry setting. This activity is significant because Controlled Folder Access is designed to protect critical folders from unauthorized access, including ransomware attacks. If this activity is confirmed malicious, it could allow attackers to bypass a key security feature, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of sensitive files.",
