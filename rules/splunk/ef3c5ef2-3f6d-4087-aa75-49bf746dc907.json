  "description": "The following analytic identifies suspicious WMI command lines querying for running processes or services. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific process and command-line events. This activity is significant as adversaries often use WMI to gather system information and identify services on compromised machines. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could allow attackers to map out the system, identify critical services, and plan further attacks, potentially leading to privilege escalation or persistence within the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
