  "description": "The following analytic identifies unauthorized Active Directory replication requests initiated from non-domain controller locations. It leverages EventCode 4662 to detect when a computer account with replication permissions creates a handle to domainDNS, filtering out known domain controller IP addresses. This activity is significant as it may indicate a DCSync attack, where an attacker with privileged access can request password hashes for any or all users within the domain. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential full domain compromise.",
