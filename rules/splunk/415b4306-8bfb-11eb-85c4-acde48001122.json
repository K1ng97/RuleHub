  "description": "This analytic has been deprecated in favor of \"Windows CertUtil Download\". The following analytic detects the use of certutil.exe to download files using the `-urlcache` and `-f` arguments. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on command-line executions that include these specific arguments. This activity is significant because certutil.exe is typically used for certificate services, and its use to download files from remote locations is uncommon and potentially malicious. If confirmed, this behavior could indicate an attempt to download and execute malicious payloads, leading to potential system compromise and unauthorized data access.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
