  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of sdbinst.exe with parameters indicative of silently creating a shim database. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line arguments. This activity is significant because shim databases can be used to intercept and manipulate API calls, potentially allowing attackers to bypass security controls or achieve persistence. If confirmed malicious, this could enable unauthorized code execution, privilege escalation, or persistent access to the compromised system.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
