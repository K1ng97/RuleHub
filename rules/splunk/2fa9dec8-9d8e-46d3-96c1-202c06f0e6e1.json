  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious PDF viewer processes spawning browser application child processes. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and parent process names. This activity is significant as it may indicate a PDF spear-phishing attempt where a malicious URL link is executed, leading to potential payload download. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute code, escalate privileges, or persist in the environment by exploiting the user's browser to connect to a malicious site.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
