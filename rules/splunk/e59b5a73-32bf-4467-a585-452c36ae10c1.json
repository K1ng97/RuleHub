  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of MOFComp.exe loading a MOF file, often triggered by cmd.exe or powershell.exe, or from unusual paths like User Profile directories. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) data, focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line executions. This activity is significant as it may indicate an attacker using WMI for persistence or lateral movement. If confirmed malicious, it could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code, maintain persistence, or escalate privileges within the environment.",

These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model.
