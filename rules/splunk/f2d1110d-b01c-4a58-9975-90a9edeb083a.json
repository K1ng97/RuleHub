  "name": "Linux Auditd File Permissions Modification Via Chattr",
  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious file permissions modifications using the chattr command, which may indicate an attacker attempting to manipulate file attributes to evade detection or prevent alteration. The chattr command can be used to make files immutable or restrict deletion, which can be leveraged to protect malicious files or disrupt system operations. By monitoring for unusual or unauthorized chattr usage, this analytic helps identify potential tampering with critical files, enabling security teams to quickly respond to and mitigate threats associated with unauthorized file attribute changes.",

    "condition": "To implement this detection, the process begins by ingesting auditd data, that consists of SYSCALL, TYPE, EXECVE and PROCTITLE events, which captures command-line executions and process details on Unix/Linux systems. These logs should be ingested and processed using Splunk Add-on for Unix and Linux (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/833), which is essential for correctly parsing and categorizing the data. The next step involves normalizing the field names  to match the field names set by the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to ensure consistency across different data sources and enhance the efficiency of data modeling. This approach enables effective monitoring and detection of linux endpoints where auditd is deployed",
