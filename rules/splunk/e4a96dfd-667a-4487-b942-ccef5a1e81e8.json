  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the `Find-InterestingDomainAcl` cmdlet, part of the PowerView toolkit, using PowerShell Script Block Logging (EventCode=4104). This detection leverages logs to identify when this command is run, which is significant as adversaries may use it to find misconfigured or unusual Access Control Lists (ACLs) within a domain. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to identify privilege escalation opportunities or weak security configurations in Active Directory, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further exploitation.",
