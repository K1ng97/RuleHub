  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the findstr command to search for unsecured credentials in Group Policy Preferences (GPP). It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions involving findstr.exe with references to SYSVOL and cpassword. This activity is significant because it indicates an attempt to locate and potentially decrypt embedded credentials in GPP, which could lead to unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to escalate privileges or gain access to sensitive systems and data within the domain.",

These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model.
