  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious usage of BitLockerToGo.exe, which has been observed being abused by Lumma stealer malware. The malware leverages this legitimate Windows utility to manipulate registry keys, search for cryptocurrency wallets and credentials, and exfiltrate sensitive data. This activity is significant because BitLockerToGo.exe provides functionality for viewing, copying, and writing files as well as modifying registry branches - capabilities that the Lumma stealer exploits for malicious purposes. If confirmed malicious, this could indicate an active data theft campaign targeting cryptocurrency wallets, browser credentials, and password manager archives. The detection focuses on identifying BitLockerToGo.exe execution patterns that deviate from normal system behavior.",
