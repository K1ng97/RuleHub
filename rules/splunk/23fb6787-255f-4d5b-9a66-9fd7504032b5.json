  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of AppCmd.exe to disable HTTP logging on IIS servers. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution events where AppCmd.exe is used with specific parameters to alter logging settings. This activity is significant because disabling HTTP logging can help adversaries hide their tracks and avoid detection by removing evidence of their actions. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to operate undetected, making it difficult to trace their activities and respond to the intrusion effectively.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model.
