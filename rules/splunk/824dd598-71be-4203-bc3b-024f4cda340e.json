  "name": "Windows Modify Registry Regedit Silent Reg Import",
  "description": "The following analytic detects the modification of the Windows registry using the regedit.exe application with the silent mode parameter. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant because the silent mode allows registry changes without user confirmation, which can be exploited by adversaries to import malicious registry settings. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to persist in the environment, escalate privileges, or manipulate system configurations, leading to potential system compromise.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
