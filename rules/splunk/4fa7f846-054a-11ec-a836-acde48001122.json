  "description": "The following analytic identifies the execution of the Get-DomainTrust command from PowerView using PowerShell, which is used to gather domain trust information. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process and command-line telemetry. This activity is significant as it indicates potential reconnaissance efforts by an adversary to understand domain trust relationships, which can inform lateral movement strategies. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to map out the network, identify potential targets, and plan further attacks, potentially compromising additional systems within the domain.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
