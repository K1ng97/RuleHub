  "description": "The following analytic detects a CrowdStrike alert with MEDIUM severity indicates a potential threat that requires prompt attention. This alert level suggests suspicious activity that may compromise security but is not immediately critical. It typically involves detectable but non-imminent risks, such as unusual behavior or attempted policy violations, which should be investigated further and mitigated quickly to prevent escalation of attacks.",
