  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of the 'c89' command with elevated privileges, which can be used to compile and execute C programs as root. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process creation events that include command-line arguments. This activity is significant because it indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt, allowing a user to execute arbitrary commands as root. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to full system compromise, enabling the attacker to gain root access and execute any command with elevated privileges.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
