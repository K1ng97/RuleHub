  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of AppCmd.exe to install a new module in IIS. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process names and command-line executions. This activity is significant as adversaries may use it to install webshells or backdoors, leading to credit card scraping, persistence, and further post-exploitation. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to maintain persistent access, execute arbitrary code, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information from the compromised web server.",

These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model.
