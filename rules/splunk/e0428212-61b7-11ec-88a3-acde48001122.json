  "description": "The following analytic detects the creation or enabling of services on Linux platforms using the systemctl or service tools. It leverages Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) logs, focusing on process names, parent processes, and command-line executions. This activity is significant as adversaries may create or modify services to maintain persistence or execute malicious payloads. If confirmed malicious, this behavior could lead to persistent access, data theft, ransomware deployment, or other damaging outcomes. Monitoring and investigating such activities are crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
