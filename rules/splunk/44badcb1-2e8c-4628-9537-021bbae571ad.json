  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the `sfc.exe` utility, in order to stop the Immunet Protect service. The Sfc.exe utility is part of Cisco Secure Endpoint installation. This detection leverages telemetry from the endpoint, focusing on command-line executions involving the `-k` parameter. This activity is significant as it indicates potential tampering with defensive mechanisms. If confirmed malicious, attackers could partially blind the EDR, enabling further compromise and lateral movement within the network.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
