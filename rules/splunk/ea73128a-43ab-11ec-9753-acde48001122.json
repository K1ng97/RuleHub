  "description": "The following analytic detects the use of the .NET compiler csc.exe for on-the-fly compilation of potentially malicious .NET code. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on specific command-line patterns associated with csc.exe. This activity is significant because adversaries and malware often use this technique to evade detection by compiling malicious code at runtime. If confirmed malicious, this could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further lateral movement within the network.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
