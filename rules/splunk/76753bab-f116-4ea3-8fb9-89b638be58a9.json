  "description": "The following analytic identifies instances where the Windows Explorer process (explorer.exe) is executed with a URL in its command line. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs. This activity is significant because adversaries, such as those using DCRat malware, may abuse explorer.exe to open URLs with the default browser, which is an uncommon and suspicious behavior. If confirmed malicious, this technique could allow attackers to download and execute malicious payloads, leading to potential system compromise and further malicious activities.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
