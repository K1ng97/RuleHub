  "name": "Azure AD Multi-Source Failed Authentications Spike",
  "description": "The following analytic detects potential distributed password spraying attacks in an Azure AD environment. It identifies a spike in failed authentication attempts across various user-and-IP combinations from multiple source IPs and countries, using different user agents. This detection leverages Azure AD SignInLogs, focusing on error code 50126 for failed authentications. This activity is significant as it indicates an adversary's attempt to bypass security controls by distributing login attempts. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within the organization's infrastructure.",

This analytic was written to be used with the azure:monitor:aad sourcetype leveraging the SignInLogs log category. The thresholds set within the analytic (such as unique IPs, unique users, etc.) are initial guidelines and should be customized based on the organization's user behavior and risk profile. Security teams are encouraged to adjust these thresholds to optimize the balance between detecting genuine threats and minimizing false positives, ensuring the detection is tailored to their specific environment.",
