  "description": "The following analytic detects the presence of a registry key associated with the Remcos RAT agent on a host. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Processes and Endpoint.Registry data models in Splunk, focusing on instances where the \"license\" key is found in the \"Software\\Remcos\" path. This behavior is significant as it indicates potential compromise by the Remcos RAT, a remote access Trojan used for unauthorized access and data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, the attacker could gain control over the system, steal sensitive information, or use the compromised host for further attacks. Immediate investigation and remediation are required.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
