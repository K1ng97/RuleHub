  "description": "The following analytic identifies the use of Ldifde.exe, a command-line utility for creating, modifying, or deleting LDAP directory objects. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution and command-line arguments. Monitoring Ldifde.exe is significant because it can be used by attackers to manipulate directory objects, potentially leading to unauthorized changes or data exfiltration. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow an attacker to gain control over directory services, escalate privileges, or access sensitive information within the network.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
