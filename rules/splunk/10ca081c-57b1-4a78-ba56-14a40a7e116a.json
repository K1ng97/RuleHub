  "description": "The following analytic detects modifications to the Windows registry that disable the Windows Defender phishing filter. It leverages data from the Endpoint.Registry data model, focusing on changes to specific registry values related to Microsoft Edge's phishing filter settings. This activity is significant because disabling the phishing filter can allow attackers to deceive users into visiting malicious websites without triggering browser warnings. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to users unknowingly accessing harmful sites, resulting in potential security incidents or data compromises.",
