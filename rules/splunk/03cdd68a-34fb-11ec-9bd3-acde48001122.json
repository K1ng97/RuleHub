  "description": "The following analytic detects suspicious calendar invites sent via GSuite, potentially indicating compromised accounts or malicious internal activity. It leverages GSuite calendar logs, focusing on events where a high volume of invites (over 100) is sent within a 5-minute window. This behavior is significant as it may involve the distribution of malicious links or attachments, posing a security risk. If confirmed malicious, this activity could lead to widespread phishing attacks, unauthorized access, or malware distribution within the organization.",
