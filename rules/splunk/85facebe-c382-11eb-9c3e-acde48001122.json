  "description": "The following analytic detects the execution of command-line parameters commonly associated with REVIL ransomware, such as \"-nolan\", \"-nolocal\", \"-fast\", and \"-full\". It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on process execution logs mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. This activity is significant because these parameters are indicative of ransomware attempting to encrypt files on a compromised machine. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to widespread data encryption, rendering critical files inaccessible and potentially causing significant operational disruption.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
