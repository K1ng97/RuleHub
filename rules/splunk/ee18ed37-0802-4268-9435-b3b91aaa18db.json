  "name": "PowerShell - Connect To Internet With Hidden Window",
  "description": "The following analytic detects PowerShell commands using the WindowStyle parameter to hide the window while connecting to the Internet. This behavior is identified through Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) telemetry, focusing on command-line executions that include variations of the WindowStyle parameter. This activity is significant because it attempts to bypass default PowerShell execution policies and conceal its actions, which is often indicative of malicious intent. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute commands stealthily, potentially leading to unauthorized data exfiltration or further compromise of the endpoint.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
