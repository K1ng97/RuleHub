  "description": "The following analytic detects potential access or modification of the /etc/sudoers file on a Linux system. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on processes like \"cat,\" \"nano,\" \"vim,\" and \"vi\" accessing the /etc/sudoers file. This activity is significant because the sudoers file controls user permissions for executing commands with elevated privileges. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could gain persistence or escalate privileges, compromising the security of the targeted host.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
