  "description": "The following analytic detects the modification of the registry to disable Windows Defender's Enhanced Notification feature. It leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, specifically monitoring changes to the registry path associated with Windows Defender reporting. This activity is significant because disabling Enhanced Notifications can prevent users and administrators from receiving critical security alerts, potentially allowing malicious activities to go unnoticed. If confirmed malicious, this action could enable an attacker to bypass detection mechanisms, maintain persistence, and escalate their activities without triggering alerts.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
