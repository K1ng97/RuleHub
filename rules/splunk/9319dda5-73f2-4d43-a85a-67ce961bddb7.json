  "description": "The following analytic identifies the execution of rundll32.exe with the DLL function names \"Start\" and \"StartW,\" commonly associated with Cobalt Strike payloads. This detection leverages data from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents, focusing on command-line executions and process metadata. This activity is significant as it often indicates the presence of malicious payloads, such as Cobalt Strike, which can lead to unauthorized code execution. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow attackers to inject shellcode, escalate privileges, and maintain persistence within the environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) agents. These agents are designed to provide security-related telemetry from the endpoints where the agent is installed. To implement this search, you must ingest logs that contain the process GUID, process name, and parent process. Additionally, you must ingest complete command-line executions. These logs must be processed using the appropriate Splunk Technology Add-ons that are specific to the EDR product. The logs must also be mapped to the `Processes` node of the `Endpoint` data model. Use the Splunk Common Information Model (CIM) to normalize the field names and speed up the data modeling process.",
