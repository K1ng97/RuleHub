  "description": "The following analytic detects the creation or update of a Kubernetes pod with host network attachment. It leverages Kubernetes Audit logs to identify pods configured with host network settings. This activity is significant for a SOC as it could allow an attacker to monitor all network traffic on the node, potentially capturing sensitive information and escalating privileges. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and service disruptions, severely impacting the security and integrity of the Kubernetes environment.",

    "condition": "The detection is based on data that originates from Kubernetes Audit logs. Ensure that audit logging is enabled in your Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes audit logs provide a record of the requests made to the Kubernetes API server, which is crucial for monitoring and detecting suspicious activities. Configure the audit policy in Kubernetes to determine what kind of activities are logged. This is done by creating an Audit Policy and providing it to the API server. Use the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector for Kubernetes to collect the logs. This doc will describe how to collect the audit log file https://github.com/signalfx/splunk-otel-collector-chart/blob/main/docs/migration-from-sck.md. When you want to use this detection with AWS EKS, you need to enable EKS control plane logging https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/control-plane-logs.html. Then you can collect the logs from Cloudwatch using the AWS TA https://splunk.github.io/splunk-add-on-for-amazon-web-services/CloudWatchLogs/.",
